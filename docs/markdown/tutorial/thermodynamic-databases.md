## SUPCRT92 Databases
current
The table below shows the current available built-in databases in Reaktoro and their description.

| Built-in Database | Description
|-|-
| [supcrt98.xml] | Derived from the SUPCRT92@sup{@cite Johnson1992} database file [slop98.dat], **without** organic species.
| [supcrt07.xml] | Derived from the SUPCRT92@sup{@cite Johnson1992} database file [slop07.dat], **without** organic species.
| [supcrt98-organics.xml] | Derived from the SUPCRT92@sup{@cite Johnson1992} database file [slop98.dat], **with** organic species.
| [supcrt07-organics.xml] | Derived from the SUPCRT92@sup{@cite Johnson1992} database file [slop07.dat], **with** organic species.


This file was produced by converting  database  has been produced for %Reaktoro is produced from the is the SUPCRT92@sup{@cite Johnson1992} database which contains parameters for the revised *Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers* (HKF) equations of state for the calculation of standard thermodynamic properties of hundreds of aqueous species as well as Maier--Kelly coefficients for the calculation of standard thermodynamic properties of gases and minerals at temperatures 0 to 1000 Â°C and pressures 1 to 5000 bar.

that should be found **at the same directory from where the application is executed!** For convenience, Reaktoro also maintains a few built-in databases, including `supcrt98.xml`, whose files need not be found along with the application. Thus, if no file `supcrt98.xml` is found, the [Database](@ref Reaktoro::Database) object will be initialized with the built-in database instead.
